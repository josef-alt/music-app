# Why?
Maintaining a decent music library on streaming services is impossible because no one service has every song available and availability is constantly in flux. We really had everything figured out back when napster and vinyl records were popular. No changing availabilty, no network requirements, and permanent ownership. On the other hand, most local audio players are severely bloated and try to do too much to satisfy the masses. That is why I made my own that only satisfies my own wants.
